# Algorithms

Personal implementations of algorithms of interest to me.

## 📚 Categories

The project structure is strictly organized by the **functional intent** each algorithm plays. instead of grouping by complexity or field, algorithms are categorized by their functional purpose. This functional-based organization highlights the specific utility of each method.

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [**approximation**](./approximation/) | Least squares, Chebyshev polynomials, splines, regularized regression |
| [**clustering**](./clustering/) | K-means clustering algorithm |
| [**differential-equations**](./differential-equations/) | Euler method, Runge-Kutta, Forward-Backward Sweep |
| [**fractals**](./fractals/) | Mandelbrot set visualization |
| [**interpolation**](./interpolation/) | Lagrange polynomial interpolation |
| [**linear-algebra**](./linear-algebra/) | Direct (Gaussian, LU, Cholesky) and Iterative (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR, CG) solvers |
| [**numerical-differentiation**](./numerical-differentiation/) | Finite difference schemes (Forward, Backward, Central) |
| [**numerical-integration**](./numerical-integration/) | Rectangular methods (Left, Right, Midpoint rules) |
| [**optimization**](./optimization/) | Gradient descent, Hill climbing, Simulated annealing, Dynamic programming, Evolutionary algorithms |
| [**random-number-generators**](./random-number-generators/) | Pseudo-random (LCG) and Quasi-random (Additive Recurrence) generators |
| [**estimation**](./estimation/) | Maximum Likelihood Estimation |
| [**stochastic-processes**](./stochastic-processes/) | Brownian motion, Markov chains, Random walks, SDEs (SIRD Model) |

## 🎯 Philosophy

The main principles followed in these implementations are **portability** and **explainability**:

- All implementations are written in **Jupyter Notebook** format
- **Explicitness is favored over performance**
- Rich visualizations and step-by-step explanations
- Designed for knowledge exchange and community involvement

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
