## 🎯 Philosophy

The main principles followed in these implementations are **portability** and **explainability**:

- All implementations are written in **Jupyter Notebook** format
- **Explicitness is favored over performance**
- Rich visualizations and step-by-step explanations
- Designed for knowledge exchange and community involvement

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed with Python 3
3. Navigate to any category folder and open the `.ipynb` file
