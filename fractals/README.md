## 🔑 Key Concepts

**The Mandelbrot Set** is defined as the set of complex numbers c for which the iteration:

$$z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$$

remains bounded when starting from $z_0 = 0$.

## 🎨 Visualization

The notebook generates beautiful visualizations by coloring points based on their escape velocity (number of iterations before divergence).
